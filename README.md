# README

A system for automatically filling out gender and name change documents
for transgender people.

We WON at Hack4Equality! Special thanks to Grindr and Planned Parenthood
for their sponsorship.

# Next Steps

The next steps for this project are in our Taiga.io agile tracker.

Also you can check out our mockups here:

We intend to better generalize the code to support multiple states and
add a PDF editor. The editor would allow easy positioning of the form
elements on newly added PDFs for additonal states.

MORE COMING SOON
